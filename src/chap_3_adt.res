  A common source of confusion when you are beginning is to confuse
  between a type defintion and values. 
  
  The `type` is for defining your custom data structure type. A value is
  an instance of either a primitive type, or a custom defined type.

  Here `bookFormat` is a variant type. The `paperback` & `kindleEdition`

  The `bookFormatToString` function has the following type signature:

    ```

  You can hover over `bookFormatToString` to see the type signature.
  
  The function does pattern-matching on the constructors of the variant
  data type `bookFormat`. Since there are three fixed constructors, there
  are three cases to be handled in the pattern-matching.

  The string conversion function returns a value of type `string`. So all
  three branches of pattern-matching should return a `string` type value
  on the right-hand side. The code will fail to compile otherwise. Try
  changing one the string values on the right-hand side to an int to
  see the compilation error.

  Say if you remove or comment out one of the branches like `Paperback`,
  the compiler will issue a warning. It will inform you that you forgot
  to handle the `Paperback` case. The compiler helps you eliminate a
  common source of bug in programming - forgetting to handle a case in
  code.

  In real world projects it is considered a good practice to configure
  the compiler to elevate this warning to a compilation error. Warnings
  can be ignored. But you cannot check-in code with a compilation error.
  You most definitely don't want to check-in code which forgets to handle
  a case in pattern-matching.

  The compiler exhaustively checks if you have handled all the cases in
  pattern-matching.

  The variant type `user` has constructors with additional arguments.

  The value `Guest(100)` is a valid value belonging to the `user` variant
  type defined by the constructor `Guest(int)`. The types match.

  But a value like `Guest` or `Guest("Sam")` are illegal. They do not match
  the type of the arguments in the constructor.

  Additional values can be added to a constructor separated by a comma.

  The `LoggedInUser(int, string)` has two arguments. The first argument is
  of type `int` and the second argument is of type `string`.

  The `userDescription` function takes a value of the variant type `user`
  and returns a `string` description. The pattern-matching on the left-hand
  side binds the constructor arguments to names. The bindings are available
  for use in expressions on the right-hand side.

  The first argument `LoggedInUser(int, string)` and `Moderator(int, string)`
  are both `int` type values. It is bound to the name `karma`. This represents
  the karma (or points) accumulated by a user through their contributions.

  The `Guest(int)` constructor also has a `int` type value, but it has a
  different meaning in this context. The `int` value here represents some
  random number assigned to guest users.

  You can use the variant type to model data structures with disjoint values.
  The individual values can be also contextualized through additional 
  arguments in the constructor.

  In this example we are able to represent an anonymous user, guest users,

  There is a common mistake beginners to the language make when writing

  The type signatures of the specialized draw functions like `drawText` or
  `drawRectangle` or `drawLine` would be instead implemented as:

    ```
    let drawRectangle: shape => unit
    let drawLine: shape => unit
    let drawText: shape => unit
    ```

  They often fail to recognize that the pattern matching in `drawShape` has
  already narrowed the type down to either `text`, `line` or `rectangle`
  depending on the value.

  This narrowed type value can be propagated instead of the `shape` type
  value.

  When the `shape` type value is propagated you end up pattern matching
  again, or repeating the work you already did in `drawShape` to get
  the narrowed type value.

  When you propagate the narrowed record type value the signature of
  the draw functions also become concrete:

    ```
    let drawRectangle: rectangle => unit
    let drawLine: line => unit
    let drawText: text => unit
    ```
